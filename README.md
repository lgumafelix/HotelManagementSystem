# HotelManagementSystem
A hotel management web application for a school project.

I've worked as the groupâ€™s project manager and spearheaded the design and development of a Hotel Management System that will manage the hotel information, room reservation, and customer check-in and check-out. The main functionalities of the system includes, but not limited to, checking for room availability, and if a room is available, a reservation is created. If no room is available, the customer may opt to be put on the waiting list. Checking-in, checking-out and charging a bill for the customer is another functionality designed for the employee.

This project was implemented using HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and MySQL.
